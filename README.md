# ANPR-Project

ANPR is a system designed to automatically read vehicle license plates from images or video streams. It leverages image processing and machine learning techniques to:
- Detect the number plate from an image of a vehicle.
- Extract the alphanumeric characters on the number plate.
- Recognize the characters using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
